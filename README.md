# The-Simon-game
This is a simon game.
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The website has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

I have created this game using HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
